Project Overview: Spring Application for Learning Concurrency and Security
Welcome to this Spring-based learning project designed to demonstrate key features like JWT security, role-based access control, and concurrency management using various techniques like pessimistic locking, optimistic locking, and atomic SQL updates.

This project is structured to be flexible and extendable, allowing integration into a real-world application with future enhancements.

üõ†Ô∏è Key Features
1. JWT Security with Role-Based Access Control
JWT Authentication: Secure the app with JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
Role-Based System: Manage user roles with many-to-many relationships, ensuring fine-grained access control based on user roles.
2. Flexible User Roles System
Many-to-Many Relationship: Users can have multiple roles, and roles can be assigned to multiple users.
The flexible design allows easy adaptation for future user and role management needs.
3. User Activity Logging
Track User Actions: Capture essential user activity data, including:
User login events
API usage: What actions the user performed through APIs.
API result status: Success or failure with exception details.
Additional fields logged:
Method name
Status (Success/Failure)
User IP address
4. Concurrency Management
Multiple techniques are implemented to handle concurrency in different scenarios:
a. Pessimistic Locking for Concurrency Test
Ensures that when multiple users try to book a ticket simultaneously, only one user can successfully book the ticket.
Row-level lock is applied, so other transactions wait until the first one is completed.
b. Optimistic Locking for Concurrency Test
Optimistic Locking is good for updates but not ideal for concurrent operations like booking systems.
Uses versioning to ensure data integrity but can allow multiple users to act on the same data, causing conflicts.
c. Atomic SQL Updates
The most efficient and fast solution for handling concurrency in small to medium-sized applications.
Uses a single atomic SQL update query that ensures consistent data updates even under concurrent writes.
Ideal for scenarios like ticket booking, where atomicity is a priority.
üìú How It Works
JWT Security
Protects the application by generating a token upon successful login.
The frontend must store the JWT token and include it in request headers for authentication.
Role-Based Access Control
Assign users roles, and protect endpoints based on these roles using Spring Security.
Allows easy access restriction based on user permissions (admin, user, etc.).
User Activity Logging
Tracks API interactions, including:
Successful/Failed API Calls
User activity status and exception details (if any)
Logs the method name and the IP address of the requestor.
Helps audit user behavior and trace errors.
Concurrency Management
Pessimistic Locking:
Ensures exclusive access to a resource. If two users try to book the same ticket, one user will succeed while the other will be blocked until the first transaction completes.
Uses SELECT FOR UPDATE queries to lock the row.
Optimistic Locking:
Versioning: A version column is used to ensure that a transaction only succeeds if no other transaction has modified the data in the meantime.
Useful for less frequent conflicts but less effective in highly concurrent systems.
Atomic SQL Updates:
Uses a single SQL update statement that handles the decrement in a ticket count atomically.
A fast approach to handle concurrency where simplicity and speed are the priorities.
‚öôÔ∏è Project Configuration
Security Configuration:

Configure JWT-based authentication and authorization for endpoints.
Ensure that role-based access control is properly set up to secure endpoints.
Concurrency Handling:

Choose between pessimistic locking, optimistic locking, or atomic SQL updates based on the scale of the application and concurrency needs.
This project is designed for testing purposes, allowing you to experiment with different approaches to concurrency management.
Logging:

Implement logging of user activities, including login events and API interactions, for tracking and auditing.
üìå Future Enhancements
Refactor code to align with best Spring practices and design patterns for production-ready applications.
Optimize and enhance concurrency control, possibly integrating with more advanced features like distributed locking or message queues.
Expand logging capabilities to include more granular tracking, such as user session details and performance metrics.
üöÄ Getting Started
Clone this repository and configure it as follows:

Set up JWT authentication.
Integrate role-based access control for various API endpoints.
Test concurrency with the provided pessimistic and optimistic locking mechanisms.
Review user activity logging and customize it to suit your project‚Äôs needs.
üí¨ Notes
This project is primarily for learning purposes and is not designed to follow strict production-level standards.
Custom configurations can be made based on your project‚Äôs requirements, particularly around JWT, role management, and concurrency handling.
Feel free to modify and extend the features based on your needs.
This version is cleaner, easy to read, and well-structured, with section headings, bullet points, and explanations to make it developer-friendly and scannable. It provides clarity on the purpose and functionality of the project while maintaining a concise format.
